# Computer-Architecture
This repository containes HWs for the course computer architecture in the technion 
HW1 : This simulator implements a two-level branch predictor similar to what is taught in class. The predictor configuration is flexible and defined through parameters at runtime. The simulator takes a program trace as input, predicting branch outcomes based on the instruction address. It then updates its state after the actual branch outcome is identified.
